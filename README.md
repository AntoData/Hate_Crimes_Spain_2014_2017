# Hate_Crimes_Spain_2014_2017
In this project we use folium, pandas to create a GIF file that contain maps with circles representing the number of hate crimes in each Spanish province between 2014 and 2017. We created a feature that given a country generates a map for every polygon that forms that country. So in this case, we will generate a map for the peninsula and Canary Islands in th case of Spain. We will group all maps of the peninsula and all maps of the Canary Islands together.

Also, we provide linear regression analysis and descriptive statistics for this subject.
